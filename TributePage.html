<h2>Here's a time line of Mahatma Gandhi life:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>1869</b> - Born in Porbander, Gujrat</li>
<li><strong>1915</strong>  he set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination</li>
<li><b>1921</b> - Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for various social causes and for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.</li>
<li><b>1930</b> -Gandhi led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March</li>
<li><b>1940</b> -Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism, however, was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India.</li>
<li><b>1947</b> -In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire[10] was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.</li>
<li><b>1948</b> -12 January 1948 when he was 78,[12] also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan.[12] Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating.</li>
<li><b>1948</b>- Nathuram Godse, a Hindu extremist who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest.</li>
<ul>
